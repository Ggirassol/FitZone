        <p>There are six incredible routes up to the summit of Snowdon; The Llanberis Path, The Pyg Track, The Miners Path, The Rhyd Ddu Path, The Watkin Path and The Snowdon Ranger Path. All paths vary in difficulty, duration and distance but all showcase the breathtaking beauty of Snowdonia National Park perfectly. This is definitely one of the most beautiful places in Wales.</p>
        <p>Before setting off, make sure you are fully prepared for climbing Snowdon. Plan your route carefully, check the weather forecast and make sure you have all the correct kit with you. As, unless you're taking the Snowdon Mountain Railway to the top, you'll need to be prepared for a good 6-8 hour hike and unpredictable weather conditions. Here's a little bit more information on each of the six routes up Snowdon.</p>
        <h1 id="pathLlanberis" class="story-subtitle">1. The Llanberis Path</h1>

        alt="Picture of The Llanberis path to Snowdon showing #WeRunTogether Snowdon Mountain Railway path"/>
        <p>The longest and most gradual route to the summit of Snowdon, The Llanberis Path is the most popular and easiest option. The path follows the Snowdon Mountain Railway track up from Llanberis and offers fantastic views of Cwm Brywynog, Llanberis and across the Menai Strait towards Anglesey.</p>
        <p><b>Choose this Snowdon route if… this is your first time climbing Wales' highest peak or you're with young children.</b></p>
        <ol class="story-list">
            <li><b>Total Distance:</b> 9 miles (14.5km)</li>

        alt="Picture of a view from Tge Pyg Track with two lakes of Snowdonia"/>
        <p>A classic Snowdon route, The Pyg Track is one of the shortest walking routes up Snowdon, with the least ascent. However, this route can be steep and rocky in places and is far from being the easiest route up Snowdon.</p>
        <p>It is believed that the path was named after Pen y Gwryd Hostel by climbers who stayed there and offers stunning views down to the idyllic lakes and up to the dramatic knife-edge of Crib Goch.</p>
        <p><b>Choose this Snowdon route if… you're after epic views of the Snowdon Lakes (Llyn Llydaw and Llyn Glaslyn) and of Crib Goch and Y Lliwedd.</b></p>
        <ol class="story-list">
            <li><b>Total Distance:</b> 7.3 miles (11.7km)</li>
            <li><b>Duration:</b> 5-7 hours (approx.)</li>
            <li><b>Ascent:</b> 704m</li>
            <li><b>Starting Point:</b> Pen-y-Pass (LL55 4NU)</li>
            <li><b>Parking:</b> Pen-y-Pass Car Park. Must pre-book 24 hours in advance or take the Sherpa Park and Ride Service from Nant Peris and Llanberis.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1 id="pathMiners" class="story-subtitle">3. The Miners Track</h1>

        alt="Picture of The Miners Track. Path goes over the lake"/>
        <p><b></b>Starting at Pen-y-Pass, The Miners Track runs parallel to the Pyg Track and is one of our favourite walks in Snowdonia. The route starts gradually, walking alongside shimmering lakes, before a steep ascent to the summit, merging with the Pyg Track at Llyn Glaslyn.</p>
        <p>Many people combine the two routes and climb to the summit of Snowdon along the Pyg Track and then descend via the Miners Track.</p>
        <p><b>Choose this Snowdon route if… you prefer a circular walk, rather than an out and back route. Combine it with The Pyg Track for a stunning Snowdon experience.</b></p>
        <ol class="story-list">
            <li><b>Total Distance:</b> 8 miles (12.9km)</li>
            <li><b>Duration:</b> 5-7 hours (approx.)</li>

        <h1 id="pathRanger" class="story-subtitle">4. The Snowdon Ranger Path</h1>
        <img class="story-image" src="https://www.menaiholidays.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2021/05/The-Snowdon-Ranger-Path.jpg"
        alt="Picture of a view from The Snowdon Ranger Path"/>
        <p>As one of the oldest routes up Snowdon, the Snowdon Ranger Path is one of the easiest options and much quieter than the popular Llanberis Path. Despite this, there is limited parking and fewer facilities than at the start of the Llanberis Path.</p>
        <p>The route, starting at the Snowdon Ranger Youth Hostel, takes you along a rocky track before joining the Llanberis Path and making its way up to the summit. On route, you'll be treated to incredible views of the surrounding valleys, lakes and dramatic peaks.</p>
        <p><b>Choose this Snowdon route if… you;re looking for a quieter alternative to the Llanberis Path with views of Moel Hebog and Mynydd Mawr.</b></p>

        alt="Picture of The Watkin Path showing small bridge"/>
        <p>A challenging climb, starting at almost sea level, meaning you'll be conquering the full 1,085 height of Snowdon. But don't let this put you off, the views from The Watkin Path are second to none.</p>
        <p>The route takes you through enchanting woodlands, alongside idyllic waterfalls and through the dramatic Cwm Llan. Named after Sir Edward Watkin, this steep route offers breathtaking views of Llyn Llydaw and Crib Goch and is well worth the hard work.</p>

        alt="Picture of The Rhyd Ddu Path with beautiful sky and clouds"/>
        <p>Used as the first official ascent of Snowdon in 1639, The Rhyd Ddu Path is one of the quietest routes up Snowdon. Boasting world-class views of Nantlle Ridge and the surrounding scenery, The Rhyd Ddu Path offers a different perspective of this stunning mountain. Combine this route with the Snowdon South Ridge for one of the best circular routes on Snowdon.</p>
