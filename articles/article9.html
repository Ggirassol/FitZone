                <p>BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a measurement used to assess an individual's body composition based on their height and weight. It provides a numerical value that helps categorize people into different weight ranges. While BMI is a convenient and widely used tool, it has some limitations.</p>
                <p>Underweight: A BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight. Being underweight can indicate insufficient body fat, which may lead to health issues such as weakened immune system, nutrient deficiencies, and decreased muscle mass. Individuals in this category may benefit from a balanced diet and targeted interventions to reach a healthier weight.</p>
                <p>Normal weight: A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered within the normal weight range. Falling within this category generally indicates a balanced weight for a person's height. People with a normal BMI often have a lower risk of developing weight-related health problems compared to those in other BMI categories.</p>
                <p>Overweight: A BMI between 25 and 29.9 falls into the overweight category. Individuals in this range have a higher body weight relative to their height, which can increase the risk of various health conditions. These include heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and joint problems. Adopting a healthier lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet, is often recommended to manage weight and reduce associated risks.</p>
                <p>Obesity, Class I: A BMI between 30 and 34.9 indicates Class I obesity. At this level, individuals face a significantly higher risk of obesity-related health issues. These may include cardiovascular diseases, sleep apnea, osteoarthritis, and an increased likelihood of developing chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes. Weight management strategies, including dietary modifications, exercise, and potentially medical interventions, are typically advised.</p>
                <p>Obesity, Class II: A BMI between 35 and 39.9 signifies Class II obesity. This level indicates a higher degree of obesity and further escalates the risk of health complications. Conditions such as stroke, heart disease, certain cancers, and impaired mobility become more prevalent. Comprehensive weight management programs and medical support are often recommended to address the associated health risks.</p>
                <p>Obesity, Class III (Morbid Obesity): A BMI of 40 or higher falls into the Class III obesity category, also known as morbid obesity. This level poses the highest health risks. Individuals with morbid obesity may experience severe medical conditions such as respiratory problems, infertility, liver disease, and a significantly reduced life expectancy. Bariatric surgery, along with lifestyle changes, may be considered for weight management and to mitigate associated health concerns.</p>

            <p>It is important to note that BMI has some limitations. It does not take into account factors such as muscle mass, bone density, and fat distribution, which can influence health outcomes. For a comprehensive evaluation of health and weight, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional who can consider additional indicators and provide personalized guidance.</p>
