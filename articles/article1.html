        <p>This will be the 43rd running of the London Marathon, with the event returning to its traditional April slot.</p>
        <p>The 2023 London Marathon takes place this weekend, with 50,000 amateur and professional athletes preparing to take on the 26.2-mile route around the capital.</p>
        <p>This will be the 43rd running of the London Marathon, with the event returning to its traditional April slot. It was moved to October during the Covid-19 pandemic, and remaining there in 2022.</p>
        <p>Here is everything you need to know about the race, from starting times to the route map and road closures.</p>
        <h1 class="story-subtitle">When is the 2023 London Marathon?</h1>
        <p>The marathon takes place on Sunday 23 April, with the wheelchair and professional races kicking off first. The following timings have been announced:</p>
        <ol class="story-list">
            <li>8.50am - Elite wheelchair men's and women's races</li>
            <li>9.00am - Elite women;s race</li>
            <li>9.40am - Elite men's race and mass start</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The mass participation event is expected to begin from around 10am, with a sequence of start waves to allow the course to clear up ahead. Everyone is expected to have crossed the starting line by 11.30am.</p>
        <p>Participants are given one of four different assembly areas - red, green, blue or yellow - from which they will begin. If you are running, this information should be in your registration email, which you should have received before Friday 14 April. The colour of the digits on your bib number will match your assembly area.</p>
        <p>Professional athletes usually need just over two hours to complete the course but many amateurs will take three to five hours. Participants are given a maximum of eight hours to complete the course.</p>
