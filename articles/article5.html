        <p>Starting a gym routine for the first time is daunting. Not only is the gym full of seemingly complicated, high-tech equipment, but it's also often packed with people who look like they know exactly what they're doing.</p>
        <p>But for women wanting to start exercising at the gym, walking in with a plan is the best way to combat nervousness,have the most positive experience and enjoy a safe and effective gym workout.</p>
        <p>So before you head to the gym, look for beginner workout routine for women. It has everything you need to get started: a flexible weekly schedule, beginner gym workouts for your whole body and feel-good recovery routines.</p>

        <p>A gym workout can be the underpinning of a great day... if you know what you're doing when you get there. If not, it can feel daunting stepping onto the gym floor without a scooby about what to do or where to go. (Spoilers, it's not the '80s so slogging on a treadmill in the corner isn't the best place to start.)</p>
        <p>So, if you're one of the 2.9k people who search for a 'gym workout' every month, in this guide we'll walk you through two solid gym workouts: one full body and one lower body. You'll also learn how to exercise in a safe way that keeps you free from injury or burn out. 
        (This goes too if you're looking to upgrade your home gym workouts and limited home gym equipment to a proper gym workout plan, including workout splits.)</p>
        <p>For those of you who find the thought of that first gym workout overwhelming - perhaps you're lost on knowing which free weights to use or wondering how long is a good workout at the gym - know that we're here to advise you. And that includes telling you about the best gym trainers or running shoes for your next workout, too.</p>
        <h1 class="story-subtitle">How long is a good gym workout?</h1>
        <p>A solid gym workout shouldn't be determined by the number of minutes spent in the gym. It's easy to half-arse 45 minutes of "exercise", spending most of the time on your phone and not on getting sweaty, and leave feeling like you did a "good session". What you should be aiming for is focused minutes, completing reps and sets efficiently with correct rest time, good form and challenging but appropriate weights. As with almost everything else in life, quality trumps quantity when it comes to gym workouts.</p>

        <p>The best practice for beginners at the gym is:</p>
        <ol class="story-list"> 
            <li>Keep workouts simple</li>
            <li>Stay consistent</li>
            <li>Start lighter than you think</li>
            <li>Follow an expert plan not a bunch of random Instagram posts</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There's always scope to add on weight if the weight isn't enough, but starting too heavy runs the risk of injury, especially in the early days as your body adjusts to a new routine.</p></p>
        <h1 class="story-subtitle">What makes a good gym workout for a beginner?</h1>
        <p>'As a beginner, it's important to focus on nailing your form and technique while lifting</p>
        <p>'Recovery is also essential. So, depending on your goals, scheduling two strength training days and two cardio conditioning days, with a day off after each strength day would be ideal. We want to challenge the body and give it the time to make positive adaptations to your workout demands.'</p>
        <p>Once you feel confident as a beginner with free weights or resistance machines, you may benefit from splitting your strength days like so:
        <ol class="story-list">
            <li>Upper and lower body sessions</li>
            <li>Or push and pull exercises</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Ideally, complete your cardio after strength or preferably, on another day completely. 'We want to work hard but we must focus on our recovery!' she adds.</p>
