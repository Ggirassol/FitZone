        <h1 class="story-title">What is healthy eating?</h1>
        <p>Healthy eating is a way of eating that improves your health and helps prevent disease. 
            It means choosing different types of healthy food from all of the food groups 
            (fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy, and proteins), most of the time, 
            in the correct amounts for you. Healthy eating also means not eating a lot of foods with added sugar, 
            sodium (salt), and saturated and trans fats.
        </p> 
    
        <p>Healthy eating also means getting nutrients primarily from food rather than from vitamins or other supplements. 
            Some women might need vitamins, minerals, or other supplements at certain times in life like before or during pregnancy. 
            But most women, most of the time, should get their essential nutrients from what they eat and drink.
        </p>
    
        <p>What you eat and drink is influenced by where you live, the types of foods available in your community and in your budget, 
            your culture and background, and your personal preferences. Often, healthy eating is affected by things that are not directly under your control, 
            like how close the grocery store is to your house or job. Focusing on the choices you can control will help you make small changes in your daily life to eat healthier.
